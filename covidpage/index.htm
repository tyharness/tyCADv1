Hello All,
<br>
<br><i>I've reached the end of my useful career, but  I've been asked by the firm to get the young 
lad up to scratch on some simple computer drafting and programming skills so here are some 
rather low quality and very rushed tutorials, but it's the best I can do with a killer COVID-19 virus out-there 
with the minimum of contact and working from home isolated in Lincolnshire (hence the Lincoln Imp graphic above.) 
Alas, I'm not a medical doctor or an epidemiologist but if I can help others find (or at least inspire) engineering solutions using 
some rather basic skills till this nightmare is resigned to the history books 
then it makes me feel useful. Therefore I'll skew my tutorials to find simple algorithms and CAD tools to 
address the COVID-19 outbreak.  Please feel free to make the best use of the info below - my thought is one 
idea spurns another idea and perhaps your ideas will help solve this global pandemic.  Worldwide problems 
require worldwide solutions and the thought of allowing any collateral damage is not acceptable in my book. 
<br><br>
<font color="DarkGreen"> God help the poor and vulnerable in the world.  My heart goes out to everyone who loses loved ones and thank-you to all the good people working on the front line, volunteers, shop workers, universities, school children and self-isolators.

The COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world so quick that we've been caught out. With the benefit of hindsight we all need to be aware of the symptoms and how to safely isolate ourselves from others at the earliest point in time. You can kill your own family, friends and neighbours by spreading the disease.  When I was a student Bio-Mems or 'Lab. on a Chip' was in its infancy.  Micro Electro Mecahnical Systems (MEMS) is now really intergrated into modern devices and although I didn't have or don't have any expereince with Bio Mems perhaps I could help with perhaps device design - anything to contribute to a solution of the COVID crisis.   
<br><br>
<b>Introduction to Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) </b><br><br>
MEMS devices have become fairly common place since I first looked at the design of vibrating tuning forks used for measuring angular rate back in 90s (20th C.)  25 years later, every car has a dozen sensors (air bags, traction control etc.) and every smart phone has got 3 or 4 mems devices inside the case.  Alas, I never got into the bio-mems device side-of-things but it looks like a very interesting (and now one of the most important) field of engineering for any young aspiring engineers out-there.<br><br>

"The detection of multiple target molecules in a small volume
of sample has immediate relevance in the early detection of
diseases, such as viruses of the type HIV and Herpes, which
fall in the size of 100nm......The ability to tailor the
surface properties with specific biomolecules can be used to
create chemically functionalized MEMS/NEMS cantilever for
study of physical chemistry, bio molecular biocompatibility
and interactions.........The sample mass lowers the resonance frequency
to a value of the order of few hundreds of Hz  ......The mass of herpes virus is in the range of (54-
92)e+06 dalton....The maximum number of viruses that can attach in pit is
accordingly 122.24e+06, corresponding to a mass of 18.64 ng
while the minimum mass is 10.4 ng."
</font></i>


<br>Let me just work through these numbers:<br>
1 nm = 1 e-9m,
1 um = 1 e-6m,<br>
1 dalton = 1.661e-27 kg<br>
1ng = 1e-12kg<br>

(range)Mass of virus: <br>
mv0 = 54e6 Dalton = 8.969e-20kg<br>
mv1 = 92e6 Dalton = 1.125e-19kg<br>


<br>
Volume of the pit (quoted in the above paper) is Vp = 200um x 80um x 4um = 6.4e4 um^3
<br>
Diameter of a virus = 50nm
<br>
Volume of virus Vv=4/3piR^3 = 6.4e13 nm^3
<br>
nv = Vp/Vv = 122.231e6  the max number of virus
<br>

Therefore:<br>
nv x mv0 = 122.231e6 x 8.969e-20kg / 1e-12 kg/ng = 11ng  <br>
nv x mv1 = 122.231e6 x 1.595e-19kg / 1e-12 kg/ng = 19.5ng <br>

avg. mass mv = 15ng  
<br><br>
therefore a sort of rough density, rho = mv/Vv = 15ng/6.4e13 nm^3 = 2.344e-13ng/nm^3
 
<br><br>Please note all my maths need checking over. Moudgil and Swaminathan's nano scale cantilever beam has many natural frequencies and it's intersesting and how the addition of virus mass shifts the expected natural frequencies and then you can deduce the mass of the sample.

The interaction between virus particles and the receptor layer on the
surface of PZT discs leads to an increased frequency of the radial oscillation mode. This increase may
be due to intermolecular forces in the receptor layer, which can add additional strain to the resonator
system. The use of the radial oscillation mode allows excluding much of the influence of media on the
resonance properties of the sensor. We detected viruses at concentrations of 10 5 virions ml −1 and
demonstrated meaningful differences between the frequency shifts for concentrations of 0, 10^5 , 10^6 and

virus particles [34]. The detection capability and ultrahigh sensitivity of the SiNW nanosensors are
because of their well-known properties of large surface-to-volume ratio and small size...It can be seen that the measured Young’s modulus
(from 74 to 178 GPa) is well in agreement with our previous results of tensile tests in SEM."</font></i>
<br><br>
So there is some scope for me to take device dimensions sub-micron which will make the virus mass more significant.

that of the microcantilever-based sensor. The MB sensor was used to detect phenytoin in different
concentrations from 5 to 100  ug/mL. The limit of detection of the sensor was 4.06 plus and minus 0.15  ug/mL and
the linear detection range was 5-100  ug/mL, which was within the therapeutic range of phenytoin

required amount of sample solution was only 10  uL...Microcantilever (MCL) -based biosensor is one of the label-free molecular sensing methods which has been
developed and applied in many fields, such as clinical diagnostics 1,2 , homeland security 3 , environmental monitor-
ing 4,5 and small molecule detection for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) purpose 6-8 . The static-mode operated
MCL-based biosensor with electrical readout is especially provided with real-time detection, high sensitivity, and
system miniaturization, which is potentially portable for personal diagnosis.....For small molecule concentration measurements, experiments must be
conducted in liquids such as acid, alkali, organic, etc. Therefore, the detection system should be packaged as

The above paper has developed the entire system on a pcb including how to deliver the real sample to the chip which is a major achievement.

<b>Using MEMS to build a virus testing lab. on-a-chip:</b><br><br> 

This is my attempt at designing a MEMS device but please note it is only, at best, an idealistic model and there's an awful lot of engineering needed to roll out a MEMS device in the real world.  I'm not affiliated with any business or actively working in the field of mems unless you want to give me a challenge.<br><br>
I have a little experience in designing resonant frequency mems devices therefore could we detect a small amount of virus mass with a
suspended mass spring flexure device etched into silicon and will it be sensitive enough to find a very small change in mass?? Why should we use a suspended mass and long cantilever beam/spring system: Well you get a good linearity response along with a low structural damping coefficient. As a bench mark I wanted to take a look at a single degree of freedom (DOF) model.
<br><br>

<img src="memsb.png">

<a href="mems1b1.pdf" target="_blank">mems1b.pdf</a><br>
<a href="mems1B_maths.pdf" target="_blank">mems1cmaths.pdf</a><br><br>

But I can't be sure of the real damping coefficient without experimental data which could make the change in frequency un-measurable because the q factor maybe poor.  Another pitfall will be the coupling of other (spurious) modes by accident such as a torsional motion and or out-of-plane resonance, but this can be easily designed out -- Now this I can do....


<br><br>
My idea is simply a spring mass damper(smd) described by Frahm 1909. It's now a 2 DOF problem and I believe I can shift the 2 natural frequencies apart.  You then tune the smd to match the exciting force's F0 frequency and
then all the displacement of the main system will stop, X1=0 and X2 = -F0/k2. So rather than using the second mass as a damper i'm using it in a tuning sense.  You could use the smd device in several ways:<br>
1) Add a controlled known mass equal to sample plus virus so they are equal so X1=0, 2) Active electro-thermal tuning of k2 using DC current
until X1=0 and read off the deflection, X2 with capacitive sensing comb and or the DC current, and 3)If the device is sensitive enough (i.e a sharp q factor) then the mass ratio (m1+mv / m2) will have calculatable frequency difference w2-w1 which might just indicate if the expected number of virons are present in the real sample.  
<br><br>

<br><br>


It's difficult to draw any conclusions from the above prelimary design work.  The mass of virus is very small compared to the mass of suspended structure but at least there is a greater measurable shift in natural frequency than the 1 DOF system.  Yuelin Wang, Tie Li and Heng Yang's paper above shows micro fabrication has really progressed in the last 20 years, since I played with it, therefore it looks like the suspended structure can reduced in size (sub micron) making the virus mass more significant but how do you get the sample mounted on the stage???
<br><br>
Also the maths beg the question if 3 DOF, 4 DOF discrete bob mass device are worth testing.  Then tune the forcing frequency though all the modes and you should see each bob mass stop one by one therefore you may be able to then determine mass for different viruses/bacteriums with one device - just a thought, it's been a long time since I had a light bulb moment.
<br><br>


It's a little bit fiddly to keep calculating the area and mass properties of the suspended geometry which I need to enter into the mathematical model.  A parametric cad model would
allow an infinity of parameters to be tweaked and tuned, i.e. you do not need to redraw and recalc - let's let the computer crank through the tedious stuff.  
It's a fairly complicated geometry but the time in writing the code (about 2-3 hours) tyMems1e.c will save me time in the long run and serves as a nice tutorial.  The code generates a layered DXF file and the mass properties are printed on and you can see the file opens in LibreCAD below.   Plus I want to generate FEA geometry to verify against how I think beams will deflect.  There's an open source FEA application called Z88 Aurora[see resources below].  I've had to compile the binaries for the Raspberry PI. Luckily there's an old version on git-hub because the full gui application might not run too well on the PI.

It's nice to take a look back into the history of mathematics and science because you can learn so much.  Just because we live in 
the 21st C. doesn't mean we're smarter.  But we do have the computer to crank through the calcs thanks to: Tunney, Flowers,  Turing and many more unsung heroes - take a back at what those guys achieved - truly inspirational.

A big part of being able to return to normal is the ability to track the virus through the population and to determine the R0 for each city, town and village. Also contact tracing tools because the world is a small space now. So using some rather crude c programming I've created some mapping tools of the UK/World to produce DXF files.  The projection I've used is the Airy 1830 example given by 
<a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-coordinate-systems-great-britain.pdf" target="_blank">Ordnance Survey (OS) </a> with the UK grid false datum but the rest of the world uses a World Coordinate System like WGS84 which is the most common projection both of which are classed as Transverse Mercator projections.  There are many datums usually based around your own country for obvious reasons.  Shipping and satellite mapping still use Mercator projection which is just one way of representing a 3D ellipsoid surface of the Earth on a 2D paper sheet.  Mapping the world is a fascinating subject and one my greatest heroes is

<b>My COVID-19 BLOG</b>  I just keep this updated everyday while listening to BBC Radio 4, World Service and Gov. Brief and try and make any sense out of this nightmare - It's a huge learning curve in anyone's book.
<br><br>

Please see the references below for a good grounding on the zoonosis ,diagnosis, treatment, epidemiology and pathology of COVID-19 [0,1,2,3,4,5,12,15].  It's a cruel disease as it appears in the form of mild flu like symptoms (cough, fever) and then from no where you can't breath and need O2 and intensive hospital care due to an over reaction of your body's immune system[19]. It may take 5 days to start showing symptoms, or you may have antibodies and be immune therefore there are going be a lot of asymptomatic spreaders out-there and if they contact even 5 people per day the virus will spread through the population at incredible speed. It's not clear yet if you can catch it more than once and a vaccine may be 18 months away. Alas reports from Sth Korea are starting to suggest a short lived immunity similar to flu - that's bad news.  If the virus follows an SIR model then it's clear the R0 number needs to be reduced to 1 or less to save lives and control the epidemic. The main method to reduce R0 in the UK is a social distancing policy and when you show symptoms to isolate for 14 days [ref keep checking UK gov. site for the latest updates].  That may be impossible for family, social and economic reasons so we've got to find other ingeneus ways to get R0 down.  It's not a biological problem now, it's mankind's problem now and does mankind have the sense to minimise your risk of catching or spreading the virus?  
<br><br>


UK Phase 2 - Test, Track and Trace comes into force 9.00am 28th of May.  If you have any symptoms you call for a test and isolate for 14 days. And also, if any of your contacts have reported symptoms you will have to isolate 14 days or until given clearance.  I assume if the informants test comes back negative all the contacts will informed and you can return to normal.  It's important to keep a diary of where you've been and the times and note if you’ve had close contact with others. A loose definition of close contact 2m of someone for more than 15mins or within 1m of someone face-to-face.  It's a pain but necessary, so the epidemiologists know where to look for the disease.  It's easier to lock down 20,200 or 2000 people than 20000000 or the whole country.

<hr><b>Tracking</b><br>
These numbers are only deaths and cases tested inside UK hospitals. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) total of registered deaths were issued on the 14th Apr.  There's no definitive explanation on why all registered deaths ending Apr 3rd is up 6000 on the 5 year avg.  Some suggestions that some doctor's may have been reluctant to report COVID-19 because without knowing a patients previous symptoms and with no form of testing and post mortem it's impossible to know if death was due to seasonal influenza, pneumonia or organ failure. Another suggestion is the economical, social and moral impact may have increased the suicide, homicide rates, people's fear and reluctance to visit hospitals or GP practices which may have hastened the deaths of the poorly, elderly and vulnerable. Let's face it GPs are going to be inundated with appointments when anyone gets even a mild cold for many years to come.


<br><br>
Case Fatality Ratio CFR = No. of deaths/No. of Confirmed cases is normally only valid after the epidemic event [11] <br><br>
Perhaps a better figure will be:<br>
CFR = deaths at day.x / cases at day.x-{T}<br>
(where T = average time period from case confirmation to death)

<br><br> 
I've used the data from gov. public information site [13].  These figures do not include people who have died in care homes or the wider public.  As of 29/04/20 confirmed deaths and cases form care homes have been included in the
daily figures.

<b>March 2020 summary:</b> With hind-sight, urging March it started to become apparent from the data coming from other countries COVID-19
is highly contagious and we have very little measures in place to deal with a pandemic.   Many people were misinformed that it was influenza and perhaps the gov. though a herd immunity would soon control the virus.  By the end of March a CFR of 9.6% is on par with historical pandemics.  Prof N. Ferguson IC SIR model was predicting
huge amount of deaths and a collapse of the NHS would be inevitable based on a do nothing policy.  The SIR model of virus predicts
an R0 number of 1 or less could control the CFR giving vitle time for the NHS to shawed up.  Social Distancing for the entire
country is proposed.

<b>June2020 Summary: </b> 100 days of lock-down social distancing and the cfr is still about (4361/35000=) 13%,  312654-277985 approx 35000 cases for June and alas 
43730-39369 = 4361 deaths.  I'm not sure this is success or progress but it has stopped the healthcare NHS from being overwhelmed.  Increased social unrest and sheer frustration has led to more mass gatherings.

A new more aggressive lock down is being tried from the 4th of July as the tracing system will identify outbreaks based on geographic
area.  Leicester is to still remained locked down after recorded 3x the national average of cases at the moment.


<hr>


<b>July's 2020 News and UK stratagy (My interpretation)</b><br><BR>

1/07/20: A local track and trace system is starting to come into effect.  The idea appears to be a lock down by geographical areas such as cities.

Prof Neil Ferguson of IC said (speaking on Radio 4) he believes it's inevitable to see outbreaks with an easing of the lock-down.  Possibly
the UK has no more than 8% of the population that have been infected, and that means the virus can see attack another 92% (or 50 million people).Herd immunity should not be relied upon, and we just don't really know if the 92% are immune and can catch it again.  Without
that information we can't get back to normality and even start to plan long term.  It's another suck it and see month I'm afraid.
<br><br>

2/7/20: At last some good news the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53257101" target="_blank"> water authorities </a> are checking sewage for quantity of virus which will give us some great data.  I'm sure the Roman's thought of this 2000 years ago, and if they didn't John Snow certainly did.   Don't forget to check those FIC's at hospitals and care homes guys.

<br><br>

7/7/20:  Bad news in that a second wave has been announced in Melbourne, Australia.  Australia were ahead of the UK in terms of the unlock,
but have now reinstated an aggressive lockdown.  It's only been a few days since UK relaxed lockdown (or Super Saturday),  the Fox and Hounds, West Yorks have had to shutdown.  The virus is still out-there and it loves a crowd.  The president of the Royal Society
has re-stated in the strongest terms if you're around other people then wear a mask.

<br><br>



20/7/20:  There is some good news on early vaccine trials from around the world. Plus a new treatment identified is the protein Interferon-Beta given via a nebuliser significantly lessons severe symptoms and improves recovery times. Tom Wilkinson Synairgen, "...Interferon-Beta...Helps fight off viral infections."
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53467022" target="_blank"> Southampton-based biotech Synairgen </a>
<br><br>
21/7/20:  Although the euphoric news of the vaccine yesterday was dampened down today, in that we'll have to learn to live with the virus
for life.
<br><br>
23/7/20: Walk in test centre for anyone in the UK within 30mins of everyones home in urban areas so that you can test yourself with
or without symptons and the results within 1 day has been announced. 
<br><br>
25/7/20:  Mandatory wearing of face masks to control the spread of the virus.

<b>COVID-19 Data</b><br><br>

<img src="XYdataexampleCovidDeathsUK.png"><img src="XYdataexampleCovidCasesUK.png">


<br><br>[2/7/20] I don't understand why we have missing deaths from the total?????  I found this explanation[ref uk gove], the

<i>"... methodology of reporting positive cases, to remove duplicates within and across pillars 1 and 2, to ensure that a person who tests positive is only counted once. Methodologies between nations differ and we will be making future revisions to align approaches as much as possible across the 4 nations.Due to this change, and a revision of historical data in pillar 1, the cumulative total for positive cases is 30,302 lower than if you added the daily figure to yesterday’s total..."</i>


<br><br>
So if the social distancing holds the reported cases at 1000 per day for 200 days with 15% or 150 people dying per day due to COVID, then that's around 30000 deaths total due to COVID-19.  It's a nightmare. We are around the 150 day mark so far with 45000 deaths. Perhaps the additional
15000 deaths are due to delays in the diagnosis of other disease such as strokes, heart attacks and cancer where the inevitable delays in the diagnosis and operation have been caused by COVID restrictions.  Comparing the real data to the SIR model(R1.5) then after day 200 the infected cases will start to drop quickly, but this form of control leaves a lot of people still susceptible to a second wave introduced from (say) someone travelling abroad and returning infected.  So Track and Trace, quick lock-down and ultimately a vaccine will finally get control of COVID-19.

of steam but this model doesn't include being able to catch the virus twice.  You really do need the aggressive social distancing model to stop the spread
of the virus.  From June the UK is going to track, test and trace although the guidelines on social distancing have been relaxed.
At least it's a plan.

<b>Urgent Problems that need solving</b>  These are just brain storming (possibly crack pot) ideas.
<br><br>

We've been caught with our pants down with not enough barrier and isolation controls putting undue strain on the health service, care homes, carers, shop workers.  If we defeat it we need to put in plans so we are better prepared next time.  We need to make masks sharpish quick and procedures on how to wear and keep sterile even in the UK.   They did it on Apollo 13 (50 years ago) fairly quick, and we need to channel our inner McGuyver now.   
<br><br>



<!--  *************************************************************************************** -->





<b>Short Term Outlook</b> 
<b>DIY masks</b><br><br>

This virus spreads very easily via coughing, sneezing, public speaking [18].  We have the capability to make high quality PPE in the west but what can be made anywhere in the (3rd) world cheaply and in 10 mins.  My thoughts: A simple PET 2L coke bottle - can it be formed into a reusable mask, visor and air filter with a Swiss army knife?????? You're going to need a lot of masks and the ability to disinfect them as often as you can.  You've also got to be careful using and handling your masks but wearing a mask may be effective in stopping you (esp if you're are asymptomatic) spreading the virus to others.  The logic being a virus attached to droplets is easier to catch in a filter than a 100nm virus picked up on the hands and rubbed into the eye and there is some scientific evidence [5].  Modern breathable roofing felt works along similar lines in that warm condensed vapour can escape but water droplets can't penetrate.  Also my thoughts are we need a biomedical mems device[7,8,9,13,14] desperately to analyse the vapour, sputum and blood to tell you that you've got the virus - that's not easy to design quickly but may be vital in the long run because I think we'll need to test ourselves several times a day if we are to control epidemics and keep that R0 well under 1.  


<br><br>
Gone are the days when you go to the docs with a tight chest and they say it's a bit of virus come back in 2 weeks if you're not better and then dole out antibiotics.  GPs need immediate diagnosis of a sputum or swab sample to identify if it's viral or bacterial which would be a great tool in combating the overuse of antibiotics problem.  



<br><br>
<b>Experiment 1:</b>

<a href="https://youtu.be/57ppny3KeKo" target="_blank">PET bottle Shrink Part 1,   </a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/QabY7aJAbIk" target="_blank"> Part 2,   </a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/0I-SBGKvnAU" target="_blank"> Part 3   </a>

The experiment shows it's possible to reshape PET and it does not lose it's transparancy.  It's probabably lacking when it comes
to protection against high speed debris.

<br><br>
<img src="aaa.jpg" width=530><img src="bbb.jpg" height=300><br><img src="ddd.jpg" height=300><img src="ccc.jpg" height=300>
<br>I've cut a mask and visor from a PET bottle below.  Yes, it's total rubbish but I hope it inspires you to more brighter ideas.  
PET is so often discarded to landfil or ends up in the ocean and seems such a waste - surely it can be reused/recycled.  

I've made safety edges for the visor by folding cardboard around the cut edges and it's tight enough to grip the head but easily secured with strap as well.  The mask can be shaped gently (to fit the face better) with a lighter or candle, but I want to try making a form (see below) to make in one piece by shrinking in the oven (see experiment 1). Is there a way of making a comfortable seal??  I've used a coffee filter paper but I'm thinking you could maybe try cutting up a hepa filter froma vacuum bag or cotton material and because the spout is small perhaps 1 existing mask might make 10 filters instead of one (don't forget to pierce holes in the cap first,  please don't suffocate yourself).  I've found it steams up quick, therefore we need (say) a flap valve arrangement to make it more comfortable.  Richard Williams has sent me some suggestions on flap valves, see ref [10].

<b>Long Term Outlook</b> - Living with infectious diseases with a view to keeping R0 less than 1 -- A pandemic future. </b>

<br><br>It may take many years for the virus to run out of steam and we need plans to handle
epidemic infectious diseases.  Of course viral infections can be virtual as well so the tools are needed 
to keep the virtual world with R0 of less then 1 -- Now that's what I call Object Orientated programming - I wonder if society could live without the internet again.
<br><br>
There are a lot of tough problems to solve in the UK and no ones life will remain unchanged.  It's going to take several
decades to rebuild society.  
<br><br>

<b>Health Care System:</b> <br>

Will the NHS ever return to normal and catch up with all the back-log of operations and therapy - No. Let's rebuild a new lean, 
efficient health care system from the ground up.  People live longer and have very different health care needs in the 21st C.
<br><br>
Because so many procedures are performed at hospitals hundreds of miles from home which make sense to use resources centrally buy  it takes time, costs money to return for follow up appointments just to be told the
consultant has been called away or notes have not arrived.  I'd like to see follow up patient appointments online (just like a passport application) but held at the local hospital or GP's surgery where the GP(or nurse) can also be present
and perform any additional examinations. There will be no need to send a letter from consultant to surgery and everyone is immediately up-to speed with no delays. 

<br><br>
<b>Hospital Admission</b>
<br><br>
We're not going be able to just walk in any more.  
<br><br>
<b>Hospital Visiting</b>
<br><br>
It's crucial to visit loved ones for both parties but there has to routes through hospitals to prevent the spread of disease.
<br><br>
<b>Hospital Discharge</b> of the elderly and infirm from hospital who need convalesce in their own homes.</b>

<b>Public Health</b><br>

Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced
18/05/20.

Official UK symptons as of the 18/05/20:<br>
* A new, continuous cough<br>
* Fever<br>
* Loss of smell or taste<br>

<br><br>

We're going need to radically overhaul public conveniences - self cleaning - access for the ambulant and non-ambulated disabled perhaps we could test for viruses and diseases which may flag up an early warning
for  a potential epidemic.

<br><br>

There are 100 different vaccine candidates ideas researched in the new Oxford centre [AZ211 ref:??]. Some people seem to have a greater risk of developing the worst symptoms which could be related to the number of Tcells.  IL7 increase the number of Tcells.

Some interesting news has been announced today (7/6/20) on Radio 4.  Testing in the UK by Quadram, Norwich, have found
6-9000 different versions of the COVID virus which produce similar symptoms and where 21 types seem to lead to worst problems.
Alas I fear it means symptom trackers may be less effective in tracking the virus but the R number may be much smaller than predicted
by modelling.  It's another factor need to be built into the model. Also the UK seems to have less offical symtons therefore the data
can not really be compared to other countries.

You should keep a hospital bag ready to go with all your meds. handy, all your details such as NI/NHS No (UK), Next of Kin, and your wishes in the 'event'. We should all keep a diary of where we went and who we met including times so If we fall ill there's half a chance of checking where you caught the virus and who you might have spread the virus to.  The NHS, google are developing a smart phone apps for this purpose, but not every one has the latest and greatest smart phone.

<br><br>Perhaps with a little home screening we could even get the earliest possible diagnosis for cancer which will vastly improve treatment outcomes.

It's the 21st C the space age for Christ's sake.  Feels more like the Victorian Era with the wealth-poor divide greater than ever. Food banks, immigration centres.<br><br>I despair.  Unused Knightingale hospitials??? Please open them for the poor and vulnerable.

<br><br>
<b>Agriculture:</b>

The university of Lincoln, UK have done a lot researach into the future of farming:

<br><br>
<b>Fishing:</b>

<br><br>
<b>Work Employment:</b><br>
Health and Safety in the Work place - Self tracking phone apps for employers.  When can the employee can go back to work and when they should be sent for testing.  What if an employee catches COVID-19 from work and takes it home and it kills
the elderly parents and young children???What happens when that first teacher or pupil dies from COVID-19?

<br><br>Unemployment/Furlogh Scheme<br>
Effectively the Furlough scheme paid employees to stay at home to avoid spreading the virus and depending on your and you households
vulnerability you may need financial support to pay rent/bills and buy food.  Although expensive it may be worse and cost more if the
Health care system collapses.  
Alas, some people will lose their jobs but are not vulnerable then I like to see a national service style job creation scheme ready to mobilise
within days of an out-break.  i.e. fetching food or meds. to the vulnerable, litter picking, local postal service etc. I'd like
to see volunteers either paid or receive national insurance credits that can be used to complete missing years in the state pension or
enhance your state pension at the point retirement.  Most of the UK wouldn't function if it wasn't for charity volunteers - let's enhance their state pension.

<br><br>
<b>Education</b>
<br>Let's give all kids a Raspberry Pi (at least in the UK) - you don't need fancy tablets. Just an old TV, keyboard, mouse, sd card, psu.

<b>Entertainment </b> in a lock down period and maybe the future for people of more mature age with a lack of mobility and poor health.<br>
VRML/AR mass partitipation events using a 3D avatar and possibly using the motion capture cameras the games consoles use.  Alas I'm a little too old to get into the latest and greatest tech. I was very impressed with Jean Michel Jarre's avatar show the other night.  I'm too old to travel for mass concerts
these days but it's nice to join in as an anon. avatar.  In 1980s you bought a cassette tape of your favorite artist, but now in the 21st you can be derezzed (via tcpip) and uploaded onto the grid just like Jeff Bridges.

Lindsley WG, Blachere FM, Thewlis RE, et al. "Measurements of airborne influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs.", 2010 Nov 30 </a>
<br><br>

<b>Construction:</b><br> Designing isolation hospitals with testing for infectious diseases, schools, housing estates, villages.  Safe places to isolate, test and quarantine.  What about Buckminster Fuller domes to create quick and easy to build (and dismantle) isolation/testing buildings . Simple common tessellated panels or skeletal struts covered with skin material. They could maybe serve as portable field hospitals in emergencies.  They're flat pack and could be air dropped into
countries and remote villages where you can't get trucks in by road.


<br><br>
<b>Utilities:</b><br>
We need to reduce noxious emissions to protect the ozone layer and reduce disease caused by global pollution.  The trees on the planet are the lungs so we need to reduce deforestation.  We need clever green solutions.
<br><br>

<i>Electric</i>:<br>
Interesting idea promoted by Octopus Energy for anyone with a smart meter is they will pay you to consume electric at the off-peak low demand times of the day.  I guess a more updated idea on the old ecomomy7 scheme. I'm a little cynical in that you'll have to adjust the on-peak unit higher, let's face you are a business.  But if we could heat water for the elederly, vulnerable and poor households.
<br><br>
Wind mills, hydro-electric, nuclear power  -we need a global solution.

<br><br><i>Gas</i>:<br>
Fossils fuels,  Hydrogen, methane from organic breakdown.

<br><br><i>Water</i>:<br>
Would you believe it the driest ever May in the UK -- potentially a drought period. Last thing we need is a bowser at the end of the street. No need to worry, it's a very rainy June in the UK.  More importantly we need some clever civil engineering for hydro electric
generation.  Using canals to move water from one reservoir to another. Desalination.  Upgrade sewer systems, fat trap interceptors and
monitoring stations that can test for diseases.  


<br><br>
News 19/06/20 - The Italian's have found the virus in waste water tests from Dec.2019.  This may be a good way to see what viruses and
disease are out-there and provide a 'heads-up'  and it might be worth taking more and increase the frequency of the testing.


<br><br><i>Telephone Network</i>:<br>
It's time to make sure the government agencies can contact people with a secure caller display ID and pw because telephone scams
are rife.  Plus Hospital/ Doctors Police need a secure caller ID.   It may be time to re create a goverment controlled GPO.



<br><br><i>LAN and WLAN</i>:<br>
People say that tv and the internet services are no longer luxury services and should be provided free for everyone.  I think what is really needed is that every home should be linked via a secure network (say) via smart metering linked via a fibre network and wireless routers mounted to
lamp posts which are totally independent of the world wide web.  Paid for by the Utility companies, Council Tax, GPO and National and Local Government maintained.  What about the possibly of an opt in national lottery with a monthly household picked by ERNIE but with a modest prize.  Is it big brother? - alas yes, but we need secure and reliable methods of: communication, commerce and in a democratic society electoral voting.



<br><br>
<b>Banking and Finance:</b><br>
We need a secure private computer networking in the UK.  I don't think we should be using the Internet even with cyrpto-algorithms. Why not use every lamp post in the UK to create a network.  Remember if we get a infectious computer virus then all we can do is lock down the internet and it'll be chaos - every business, bank, public sector utilities have put all their eggs in one basket.

<b>Economics:</b>

<br><br>
<b>Logistics:</b><br>
Stockpiling of masks, barrier isolation equipment.  <br><br>

<b>Retail:</b><br>
Shopping for food.  Click and Collect model, home delivery etc.

<font colour="magenta">  It's one thing putting yourself at risk but another if you kill
anyone else!</font>

What happens when someone fragrantly breaks the lock down isolation if they have symptoms. If proven you've
led to n thousand infections and n deaths???<br>  

An interesting historical case is Mary Mallon <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959940/" target="_blank">
(aka Typhoid Mary)</a>

<br>Can we really let children back to school?  What happens when the first child and teacher dies?  It might be wise vulnerable teachers
move to the online teaching for children who are or live with vulnerable family members.

<br><br>You simply fill in your symptoms every day (takes about 1min) and you can see an interactive map of UK to get a guide of how many cases of COVID ar in your area.  I haven't had any symptoms yet, but as and when a test will be sent out and I'll isolate till the NHS says it's OK to go out.  The test results should only take a few days.  Of course the more people that take up this symptom survey the more reliable the results.  If you haven't got access to the internet someone else can report your symptoms for you.
