All the z88 files generated by tyCADv1 can be found in the output/z88example directory.

I've gone for a 2 pronged approach.  

1) Generate all the input (geometry, loading etc.) files as text files directly or
2) Generate a dxf file in (any) CAD and use Prof. Reig z88x - conversion from CAD to z88 input files. z88x -iafx

You then put all the input files in the z88 bin directory (the root of the z88r solver binary) and run the solver.
z88r -c -choly

All the input files needed for z88 solver:
z88i1.txt   -- describes the geometry to the structure i.e. nodes, elements, finite elements (including type (say) Beam13)
z88i2.txt   -- the boundary conditions and loading
z88mat.txt  -- how many materials and link to file (say) 51.txt
z88int.txt  -- intergration order - just needs to be there or will spit out dummy
z88elp.txt  -- element properties - Area, Second Momemnts etc.
z88man.txt  -- flags to set up matrices for solution
51.txt      -- material properties.

see the z88 documentation for more comprehensive demostration.
