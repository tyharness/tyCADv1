This is a work in progress - rough and ready programming.  

I'm writing this software in the UK over this COVID-19 virus pandemic and feeling a bit useless.  The world's poor and vulnerable are going to suffer badly.  We've got to help poorer nations and how control and eradicate the virus.  

Features:
*Mapping
*Graphing
*html data tables
*Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device design


tyCADv1 - a simple set of c functions for use with computer aided design CAD.  I often find with various CAD applications
that they are limted and I know 5 lines of code will probably solve the problem.  Therefore here are some functions you may
find useful.  Please note it's not a graphical editor/application but produces data using the DXF format so you can import the generated data into the CAD application of your choice.

I'm using a Raspberry PI 3 which has gnu c compiler included.  Plus there's a nice open source CAD application called LibreCAD.  I'm a TurboCAD man from my working days - or at least it's the only commercial software I could afford for home use.  DXF although old fashioned still does the job.

From CLI

To compile:
make

To run
./tyCADv1


Choose from the text menu what to export to the output directory


To use LibreCAD
sudo apt install librecad

from the tyCADv1/ouput
librecad UKmapExample.dxf


To use gnuplot
sudo apt install gnuplot


gnuplot 
then paste in script

type exit to leave gnuplot

Plot the data using gnuplot script
#gnuplot whole data set
#set output 'SIR.png'
set key autotitle columnhead
set datafile separator ","
set xrange [0:340]
set yrange [0:350e6]
set title "SIR"
set xlabel "S(t), I(t), R(t)"
set ylabel "S,I,R,I+R"
plot 'SIR.dat' using 0:2 with lines ls 3 ti "S Data" , '' using 0:3 with lines ls 1 ti "I Data" , '' using 0:4 with lines ls 2 ti "R Data" , '' using 0:5 with lines lt rgb "violet" ti "I+R Data" 


or just
gnuplot SIRscriptfile -p
