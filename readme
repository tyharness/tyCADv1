This is a work in progress  rough and ready programming


tyCAD - a simple set of c functions for use with computer aided design CAD.  I often find with various CAD applications
that they are limted and I know 5 lines of code will probably solve the problem.  Therefore here's some functions you may
find useful.  Please It's not a graphical editor/application but produces data in a DXF format so you can import into the CAD application of your choice.


From CLI

To compile:
make

To run
./tyCADv1
