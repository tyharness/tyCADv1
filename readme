Ty Harness April 2020

This is a work in progress - rough and ready programming.  

I'm writing this software in the UK over this COVID-19 virus pandemic and feeling a bit useless.  The world's poor and vulnerable are going 
to suffer badly.  We've got to help poorer nations and to control and eradicate the virus.  Please feel free to use what you need to help
solve the COVID-19 pandemic.  If you use it for commercial reasons please give a donation to a charity to help the poor and vulnerable.


Features:
*Mapping.
*Graphing.
*html data tables.
*Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device design.


tyCADv1 - a simple set of c functions for use with computer aided design CAD.  I often find with various CAD applications
that they are limited and I know 5 lines of code will probably solve the problem.  Therefore here are some functions you may
find useful.  Please note it's not a graphical editor/application but produces data using the DXF format so you can import the generated data into the CAD application of your choice.

I'm using a Raspberry PI 3 which has the gnu c compiler included in the default linux distro.  Plus there's a lot of nice open source CAD/graphical applications like LibreCAD, OPENSCAD, gnuplot etc available.  I'm a IMSI TurboCAD man really from my working days - or at least it's the only commercial software I could afford for home use.  DXF although old fashioned still does the job.

I'd like to dedicate the software and work to my parents who both died of horrendous respiratory disease.

from the cd tyCADv1/ouput
librecad UKmapExample.dxf


To use gnuplot

then from the CLI type:

gnuplot 

or just
gnuplot SIRscriptfile -p


SIRscriptfile is in the output directory
